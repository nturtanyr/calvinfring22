            <p>The central system of legislation within the Kalmany government still stands as it did almost two-hundred years ago, when the Great Sock Fire of 1812 took place. Since then, the parliament of Kalmany has operated using twenty-four elected members to represent each of Kalmany's twenty-four constituencies.</p>
            <p>When elected, at 19:00 UTC each day, the parliament will convene at an assembly, where each member is given the opportunity to bring one policy to parliament that they wish to enact.</p>
            <p>Each member is then given an opportunity to discuss the policy, but they may only speak by throwing a sock into a ceremonial ring. Discussing a policy is vital to persuading the other members of parliament to the cause.</p>
            <p>Once the discussion has completed, all members will be allowed to vote For, Against, or Abstain. If the votes For can reached quorum of a third of parliament, and outnumber the votes Against, the policy will be passed and implemented by the government.</p>
