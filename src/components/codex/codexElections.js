            <h3>Elections</h3>
            <hr/>
            <p>Every citizen is given the opportunity to vote for a candidate in their constituency to represent them in parliament. Elections take place from 09:00 UTC until 17:00 UTC each day, apart from Sundays; the day of rest. Any citizen is welcome to stand for election, as long as they bring an application form to the Kalmany Electoral Commission Headquarters in Kalbal. A candidate will be asked to provide a standard list of policies as part of their platform that they may take to parliament.</p>
            <p>Election results are determined by first past the post - the candidate with the most votes is elected as a member of parliament. If there is a tie, the Kalmany Electoral Commission is dedicated to providing a solution as and when this occurs.</p>
