            <h3>Ethnicity</h3>
            <hr/>
            <p>The term 'Ethnicity' in Kalmany is a term that refers to the grouping of its citizens in terms of a social group or cultural traditions shared. This generalised categorisation of people has lead to discrimination in the past, but the Kalmany Electoral Commission is dedicated to eliminating such biases in the election system, and hopes to provide a platform to anyone and everyone who calls themself a Kalman.</p>
            <p>In the national census, the options for ethnicity were given as the following, in alphabetical order:</p>
                <ul><b>Android</b> - A person whose physiology requires electricity and/or mechanical augmentation. Prefers logic over emotion.</ul>
                <ul><b>Human</b> - A general category that has no specific definition and is often used as a default</ul>
                <ul><b>Lizard Person</b> - A person who physiology shares that with a lizard. Enjoys the sun and may or may not eat bugs.</ul>
                <ul><b>Six Fingered</b> - The six fingered people of Kalmany have often suffered discrimination, even when research shows citizens who belong to this group are more adept intellectually and physically.</ul>
                <ul><b>Third Nipple</b> - The citizens of Kalmany that identify as 'third nipple' may or may not have the physiology that gives them a third nipple. Their culture tends towards innovation and creative endeavours.</ul>
                <ul><b>Vampire</b> - A person whose physiology requires them to avoid sunlight and consume blood to stay alive. </ul>
                <ul><b>Zombie</b> - A person whose physiology requires them to consume brains to stay alive, and may or may not suffer from flesh-eating viruses.</ul>
