            <h3>Gender, Sex & Sexuality</h3>
            <hr/>
            <p>The Kalmany Electoral Commission is committed to ensuring that representation is a priority. Therefore, the various attributes that we may use in identity must be considered. The Kalmany Electoral Commission issues a survey to all citizens to give the best category to describe their Gender and Sexuality. This may not be indicative a person's true Gender or Sexuality, only how they determine themself.</p>
            <p>Pertaining Sex in the surveys issued, we ask for the biological sex of <b>Male</b>, <b>Female</b> and <b>Superfemale</b> that the citizen is currently, as determined by their biology. This information is not present in the Demography page as it is not deemed useful in actions by person.</p>
            <p>Pertaining Gender in the surveys issued, we ask for the gender identity the citizen most strongly identifies with, regardless of current or previous biological sex. These categories operate under an understanding of the widely-known binary categorisation of <b>Male</b> and <b>Female</b>, but offers that this is not a limitation to a person nor a way to discriminate or judge that citizen. The categories given are:</p>
                <ul><b>Female</b> - The citizen identifies with the binary <b>Female</b> gender.</ul>
                <ul><b>Demifemale</b> - The citizen partially identifies with the binary <b>Female</b> gender.</ul>
                <ul><b>Male</b> - The citizen identifies with the binary <b>Male</b> gender.</ul>
                <ul><b>Demimale</b> - The citizen partially identifies with the binary <b>Male</b> gender.</ul>
                <ul><b>Bigender</b> - The citizen identifies with both of the binary genders.</ul>
                <ul><b>Agender</b> - The citizen does not identify with either of the binary genders.</ul>
                <ul><b>Pangender</b> - The citizen can identify with either of the binary genders or neither - there is no preference.</ul>
                <ul><b>Genderfluid</b> - The citizen can identify with either of the binary genders or neither - there may be a preference that fluctuates.</ul>
                <ul><b>Xenogender</b> - The citizen identifies with a gender outside of the binary genders that <b>Agender</b> cannot fully describe.</ul>
            <p>Pertaining Sexuality in the surveys issued, we ask for the sexual orientation the citizen feels best describes themself. The sexual orientation here considers itself only with the biological sex of a person and does not take into account a person's gender identity - these may be entirely different. The categories given are:</p>
                <ul><b>Heterosexual</b> - The citizen is strongly sexually attracted to a biological sex that is not their own.</ul>
                <ul><b>Homosexual</b> - The citizen is strongly sexually attracted to their own biological sex.</ul>
                <ul><b>Bisexual</b> - The citizen is strongly sexually attracted to their own biological sex and one of the other biological sexes.</ul>
                <ul><b>Trisexual</b> - The citizen is strongly sexually attracted to all three biological sexes.</ul>
                <ul><b>Asexual</b> - The citizen is not strongly sexually attracted to any of the three biological sexes.</ul>
                <ul><b>Pansexual</b> - The citizen is equally sexually attracted to any or all of the three biological sexes, without needing to define.</ul>
                <ul><b>Unlabelled</b> - The citizen cannot adequately categorise their sexual orientation in the prescribed categories.</ul>
            <p>The Kalmany Electoral Commission acknowledges this is a contentious issue and would like to state that they are dedicated to equality in all forms and the surveys issued are a way of determining useful data but may not adequately describe a citizen's identity.</p>
