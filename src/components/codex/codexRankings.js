            <p>The Kalmany Electoral Commission has collaborated with Bulford University to provide the means to survey the public on a regular basis to determine a suitable scoring system against each sector of Government spending and operation. Using these surveys, each constituency is then ranked on a score of 0-10 on their performance. This information is not intended to provoke competition between constituencies and is meant to only provide a meaningful way to compare if one constituency is, without a doubt, better than another.</p>
