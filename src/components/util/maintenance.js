            <p>The Kalmany Electoral Commission would like to apologise as this page is now under maintenance to support further improvements to the website. You will not be able to access the prior functions this page provided, but we will be working to bring them back with improvements and then some. In the meantime, please check back in a few days to see any further updates.</p>
            <p>If you feel there is a fault with the Kalmany Electoral Commision website, please come see us at the Kalmany Electoral Commission Headquarters in Kalbal and talk to us personally - we would love to hear how we can better serve the citizens of Kalmany and its electorate.</p>
